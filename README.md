This repository contains small examples. The current example shows how to list installed Windows applications using a simple graphical interface.

## Usage

To list all applications installed on a Windows PC, run the script using Python (it requires `tkinter`, which is bundled with standard Python distributions).

```bash
python list_apps.py
```

A window will appear listing all discovered applications.
